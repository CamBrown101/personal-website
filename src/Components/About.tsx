        I am a Full Stack Web Developer working with HTML, CSS, Javascript,
        React, Node and SQL. Prior to becoming a developer, my educational
        background was 3D animation, and I have over 15 years of experience in
        hospitality. I discovered a love for coding during my days as a Bar
        Manager doing inventory using spreadsheets and diving into more complex
        ways I could make the process easier. I worked as an intern Junior Web
        Developer prior to attending a full-time bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs.
        This was a great experience and allowed me to get a feel for what it is
        like to work in a web development environment.
